\section{Recommendations}

Through the successful implementation of a metrics framework for the new
processing \gls{pipeline} functionality of the original fragmented
\gls{pipeline} has been met or exceeded. The current recommendation is to adopt
this new \gls{pipeline} for use, transitioning code that is fragmented for
platform compatibility: ultimately reducing overall codebase
fragmentation.

It is also recommended this effort to reduce codebase fragmentation is continued
and furthered past this and previous efforts, to unifying the rest of
the codebase.  Simplicity in development is safety and having platform-specific
execution paths and compilation is an opportunity for flaws and failures to
arise. By reducing places execution paths and compilation differ depending on
platform, faster, more stable, secure development can be achieved.
