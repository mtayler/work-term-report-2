\section{Conclusion}

Implementing metrics for the \gls{real-time} processing \gls{pipeline} brought
the functionality and features provided to parity with the old
\gls{pipeline}. The addition of metrics to the new processing \gls{pipeline}
provides easier debugging and encourages usage of this new cross-platform code.
In an effort to reduce codebase fragmentation, adding functionality to the new
cross-platform capable code encourages it's use and adoption and further
development and improvements to the pipeline. In the goal of codebase
unification implementing metrics for the pipeline was successful endeavour. The
challenges provided by supporting multiple platforms is greatly outweighed by
the ease of development, both in the conceptualization stage and the diligence
to a correctly functioning project without flaws.
